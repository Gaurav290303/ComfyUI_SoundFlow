# ComfyUI_SoundFlow ðŸŽ¶

Welcome to **ComfyUI_SoundFlow**, a collection of nodes designed to enhance your sound work in ComfyUI. This repository aims to provide tools that simplify audio processing tasks, making your workflow smoother and more efficient.

## Available Nodes

This repository includes the following nodes:

- **Mixer**: Blend multiple audio sources seamlessly.
- **Silence Trimmer**: Remove silent sections from your audio files.
- **Concatenator**: Join multiple audio clips into one.
- **Get/Set Length**: Easily manage the length of your audio tracks.
- **Trim**: Cut audio to your desired length.
- **Fade In/Out**: Add smooth transitions to your audio.
- **Ducking**: Automatically lower the volume of background audio when a primary audio source plays.
- **Simple Compressor**: Control the dynamic range of your audio for a balanced sound.
- **7-Band Equalizer**: Fine-tune your audio across seven frequency bands.
- **Preview/Player**: Play back your audio to check changes in real-time.

The nodes marked with an asterisk (*) require additional functionality provided by the compiled Rust library (effects.dll). Currently, this library is available only for Windows, but I plan to support Linux and Mac in the future.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository into your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fredconex/ComfyUI_SoundFlow.git
```

After cloning, ensure that you follow any additional setup instructions provided in the repository.

## Usage

Once you have installed the nodes, you can access them within ComfyUI. Each node has specific functionalities that can be combined to create complex audio workflows. 

1. **Mixer**: Drag and drop your audio files into the mixer node. Adjust the levels to achieve the desired blend.
2. **Silence Trimmer**: Connect your audio to the silence trimmer node. It will automatically remove silent parts.
3. **Concatenator**: Feed multiple audio clips into the concatenator node. The output will be a single continuous audio file.
4. **Get/Set Length**: Use this node to specify the exact length of your audio track.
5. **Trim**: Connect your audio and set the start and end points to trim unwanted sections.
6. **Fade In/Out**: Add this node at the beginning or end of your audio to create a smooth fade effect.
7. **Ducking**: Set the parameters for the ducking node to ensure your main audio stands out.
8. **Simple Compressor**: Adjust the threshold and ratio to control the dynamics of your audio.
9. **7-Band Equalizer**: Use this node to adjust frequencies according to your preferences.
10. **Preview/Player**: Test your audio workflow before finalizing.

## Additional Features

### Compatibility

The nodes are designed to work with ComfyUI, a user-friendly interface for audio processing. The functionality of certain nodes may vary based on your operating system due to the Rust library dependency.
